How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/SLATE-Qt` (on Mac)
or `slated`/`slate-qt` (on Linux).

Compatibility
==============

SLATE Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

SLATE Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
