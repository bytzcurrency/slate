summary:   peer-to-peer network based digital currency
description: |
  slate is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
  is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
  trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
  transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
  check for double-spending.
